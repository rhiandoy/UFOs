## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to design a webpage that effectively filters through UFO sightings based on five criteria including date, city, state, country, and shape. When viewing the intial wepbage, users will be able to filter through the table to read more in depth information about the duration of the sightings as well as comments on what was seen specifically.

Below is an overview of the webpage created

## Results

Using the search table, you can enter any amount of the criteria depending on how specific you want to be in your search. To reset the data you have the option to refresh the webpage using the UFO sightings tab at the top or you can simply delete the current filters and enter new ones.
### Filter By Date

## Summary

A possible drawback to the design of this webpage is based on the lack of a visual "enter" button on the webpage. This can cause confusion on whether the data we are searching for is updating or not. When creating the webpage I actually experienced this confusion for a moment.

### Recommendations for Development

This webpage is in beginner stages and can go even more in depth with added user friendly buttons. I would also recommend having a sub filter of sightings from most recent to oldest so that you are not continuously typing in sightings day by day.
